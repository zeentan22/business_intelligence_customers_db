# Business Intelligence Dashboard Project

This is a simple project that features using MySQL and Tableau to create a simple business intelligence dashboard.

MySQl database script is taken from https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx

Query scripts and csv files are done by myself. Results from sql query scripts are exported as csv files which are then used for Tableau.
